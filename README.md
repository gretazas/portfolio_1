## Invitation to learn about The Project


This is my very first page that I actually finished to the point where I can share my web page with friends, family and coworkers. This is the first step in my journey towards a career in full-stack web development. And I know for sure that there will be many more in the future. Mostly I enjoyed creating web page appearance and I was trying to imagine that I am helping real person to create their business that they love representation. 
The biggest challenge of all was responsive web design, probably because of lack of experience. I believe it will be way easier in the future with practice.
I had great time to practice form elements, use divs, spans, sections. Learning to apply different css properties and their values. I know that every full-stack web developer must master HTML and CSS, as well as learn how to program browsers, servers, and databases. Throughout my course in [Code Institute](www.codeinstitute.net) I have learnt HTML and CSS fundamental and with project is result of my efforts. 
In the first index.html page I created a navigation menu and only three options to decide where the party should take place. It was my intention not to confuse customers with information overload. After that they are guided to take a step to Place Order. On the page Place Order I have located a button with an indicator to open a list in order to choose a theme for the party. Every list item would open in a new tab so after they decide which theme is great for their kids party,  they could easily go back to my original page to fill out the form for the party.
 
I chose this topic on the page of my love for kids and enjoyment spending time with some great activities. That also reminded me of my time spent in “Lithuanian language Sunday school”, where i was playing Lithuanisan games and teaching my native lituanian language kids between 6-10 year old.
